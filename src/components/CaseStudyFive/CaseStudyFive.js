          <h4>The video concludes with the addition of the TropicFeel logo, accompanied 
            by a typewriter text effect that spells out "TropicFeel." This subtle yet 
            sophisticated animation technique not only underscores the brand identity 
            but also complements the videoâ€™s overall aesthetic. The final 10-second piece 
            is a testament to the fusion of traditional sketching, modern coding, 
            and digital animation, culminating in a visually engaging and narratively 
            compelling showcase of the all-terrain shoes. I am delighted with the outcome, 
            which not only met but exceeded my creative expectations, affirming the effectiveness 
            of integrating diverse design methodologies.</h4>
