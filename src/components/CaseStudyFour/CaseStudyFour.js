          <h2>ITERATIONS & REFINEMENT</h2>
          <h4>The creative process is seldom linear, and this project was no 
            exception. Each stage of the animation—from the initial sketches to the 
            final sequences—underwent numerous revisions and refinements. The initial 
            transitions between textures felt too abrupt, lacking the organic feel necessary 
            to convey the seamless adaptation of the AT X shoes to different environments. 
            I experimented with various animation techniques, adjusting timings and transition 
            styles to achieve the right balance between visual impact and narrative clarity. 
            Additionally, feedback sessions were integral, providing fresh perspectives 
            that led to iterative improvements, ensuring that every frame of the animation 
            contributed purposefully to the overall story.
